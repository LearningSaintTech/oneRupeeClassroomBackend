# Apple IAP Verification Fix

## Problem Identified

Your Apple In-App Purchase verification was failing with **Status 21008** error:
> "This receipt is from the production environment, but it was sent to the sandbox environment for verification"

### Root Cause
1. **Hardcoded Sandbox Environment**: All verification functions were hardcoded to use `isSandbox = true`
2. **No Environment Detection**: No logic to automatically detect whether a receipt is from production or sandbox
3. **Environment Mismatch**: When users make real purchases (production receipts), the backend tried to verify them against sandbox environment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Verification Function
Updated `verifyAppleReceiptWithServer()` in all controllers with:
- **Automatic Environment Detection**: Detects environment mismatch errors (21007, 21008)
- **Auto-Retry Logic**: Automatically retries with correct environment
- **Better Logging**: Enhanced logging for debugging

### 2. Files Updated
- `userPanel/controllers/UserbuyCourse/userCourseController.js`
- `userPanel/controllers/certificate/downloadCertificateController.js`
- `userPanel/controllers/recordedLessons/recordedLessons.js`
- `userPanel/controllers/InternshipLetter/internshipLetterController.js`

### 3. Key Changes

#### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
const verificationResult = await verifyAppleReceiptWithServer(signedTransaction, true); // Always sandbox
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const verificationResult = await verifyAppleReceiptWithServer(signedTransaction, false); // Production with auto-retry
```

#### Enhanced Verification Logic:
```javascript
// Handle environment mismatch errors
if (result.status === 21007) {
  // Receipt is from sandbox but sent to production - retry with sandbox
  console.log("ðŸ”„ Environment mismatch detected (21007) - retrying with sandbox");
  // Retry with sandbox...
} else if (result.status === 21008) {
  // Receipt is from production but sent to sandbox - retry with production
  console.log("ðŸ”„ Environment mismatch detected (21008) - retrying with production");
  // Retry with production...
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **First Attempt**: Tries verification with production environment (since your app is live)
2. **Environment Detection**: If Apple returns 21008 (production receipt sent to sandbox), automatically retries with production
3. **Fallback**: If Apple returns 21007 (sandbox receipt sent to production), retries with sandbox
4. **Success**: Returns verified transaction data

## Benefits

âœ… **Fixes Status 21008 Error**: Production receipts now verify correctly  
âœ… **Backward Compatible**: Still works with sandbox receipts during testing  
âœ… **Automatic Detection**: No manual environment switching needed  
âœ… **Better Error Handling**: Clear logging for debugging  
âœ… **No "Already Purchased" Issues**: Proper verification prevents false positives  

## Testing

After deploying this fix:
1. Test with real production purchases
2. Verify that Status 21008 errors are resolved
3. Check that "already purchased" messages no longer appear incorrectly
4. Monitor logs for successful verification messages

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure your backend has:
```bash
APPLE_SHARED_SECRET=your_apple_shared_secret_here
```

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated backend code
2. Test with real production purchases
3. Monitor logs for successful verifications
4. Remove any temporary debugging code if needed

The fix ensures your Apple IAP verification works seamlessly for both sandbox testing and production purchases.
